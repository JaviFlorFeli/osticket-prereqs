<h2>Installation Steps</h2>

<p>
1.) To start off you are going to create a virtual machine using https://portal.azure.com/. Setup your virtual machine with Windows 10 Pro, version 22H2. It is recommended to run this virtual machine using atleast 2 vcpu and 16gb of memory, as it will help th VM run smoother.

2.) Once you have created you VM, you will want to connect to it using the VM's public Ip address it was assigned. You will insert the Ip address into the Remote Desktop Connection app to connect to the VM.

  *Make sure that every common HTTP feature is checked*

  To ensure that you have properly installed/ enabled IIS. Open up a browser and type in the search bar 127.0.0.1. Your screen should look similar to this

  Now that IIS is running, Go over to the installation files and download the PHP manager for IIS (PHPManagerForIIS_V1.5.0msi), go through with the install wizard and complete the installation.
  Next from the Installation files, Download and install the rewrite module (rewrite_amd64_en-US.msi)
  
  You will create a folder in the (C:) drive and name it PHP

Next from the installation files, download PHP 7.3.8((php-7.3.88-nts-Win32-VC15-x866.zip). You may recieve a warning on the download. If so, make sure you choose to keep the file.

 After downloading PHP you will unzip the contents into the C:\PHP folder

  Download and install the VC_redist.x86.exe from the installation files. Go through the setup wizard to finish setting up and installing the VC_redist.x86.exe.
  
  Download and install MySQL 5.5.62 (mysql-5.5.62-win32.msi) Run the setup wizard: Typical Setup -> Launch Configuration Wizard (after install) -> Standard Configuration ->

For the sake of this lab, you will use a simple password for the root password. Such as "Password1"

 The next step is to run IIS as an administrator, you do that by right clicking on IIS just before opening the application and you select the "run as administrator" option. Your screen should look like this.

2.) php_intl.dll

3.) php_opcache.dll

head over to the file explorer and search for C;\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\include\ost-sampleconfig.php

We are going to rename the ost-sampleconfig.php to ost-config.php, essentially just removing the sample part of the name

Right click on the file and go to properties. From there click security, click on advance, and disable the inheritance. We will select Remove all inherited permissions from this object.

Now we will add new permissions.

Select a principal

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xrtwdzi.png" height="40%" width="40%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>

In the box, type "Everyone"

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ORqV57T.png" height="40%" width="40%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>

Select the full control box to automatically select the rest of the boxes

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/lXXwQqA.png" height="40%" width="40%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>

Click Apply and OK

You will continue to setup osTicket in the browser. Click Continue on the osTicket browser page. Fill out the page as required

From the Installation files we will download, HeidiSQL

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/RaYmFUQ.png" height="40%" width="40%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>

Create a new session

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JsHM1I5.png" height="40%" width="40%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>

Make sure that the user is "root" and that the pass word is "password1"

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/mZ3QG0e.png" height="40%" width="40%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>

Once connected to the session, go back to the Database settings and in the user you will put "root" and the password is "Password1"

We will now create a new database within HeidiSQL. In Heidi right click on the left side where is says "Unnamed", select "create new", and then select "database". Name the new database osTicket. Once we have the new database setup go back to the osTicket browser and under MySQL Database type in osTicket.

The last step is to do some clean up. We will want to delete the setup folder in our system. -Delete: C:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\setup. Make sure to only delete the setup folder

We then will want to set the permissions back to "Read" in the ost-config.php file.
